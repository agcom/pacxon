# PacXon

A partial PacXon game clone in C, on CLI (you can play the original version [here](https://www.pacxon.net/)).

This game was my final project for the **computer fundamentals and programming** university course, made in **early 2019**.

## Simple build & run

> Pro-tip: use an **IDE** to build and run the project.

### Ubuntu

> Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

- `sudo apt install cmake gcc make libncurses-dev`.

Or

- `sudo apt install gcc libncurses-dev`

### Other Operating Systems, including Windows

Figure it out :slightly_smiling_face:.
