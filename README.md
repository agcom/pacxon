# PacXon

A partial PacXon game clone in C & Windows cmd.exe (you can play the original version [here](https://www.pacxon.net/)).

This game was my final project for the **computer fundamentals and programming** university course, made in **early 2019**.

## Simple build & run

Open the project in Code::Blocks 17.12 (with MinGW) on a Windows OS, and hit Build and run.

> Running the game might be tricky; because it is left behind as a **legacy**, and it is not packaged properly.
