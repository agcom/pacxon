# PacXon

A partial PacXon game clone in C & Windows cmd.exe (you can play the original version [here](https://www.pacxon.net/)).

This game was my final project for the **computer fundamentals and programming** university course, made in **early 2019**.

## Simple build & run

```shell
cmake . && make && ./PacXon
```
